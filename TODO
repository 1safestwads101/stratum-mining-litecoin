TODO File (in no particular order):

SQL Connection pooling: sqlalchemy
Share Archiving in DB
	- Perhaps separate table for found shares?

Add a "script" to add,list,disable users

Flush all Pending shares on shutdown (I really don't know how to do this.)

create index if not exists shares_time_username ON shares(time,username)

Variable difficulty should not be able to go higher than current difficulty

Possibly allow non-local Coinbase (payaddress). (If we do, ensure we have to Disable checking in config)

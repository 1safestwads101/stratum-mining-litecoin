TODO File (in no particular order):

Add Database interface in a modular way
- Utilize fifo queue's
- Allow sqlite database by default
- Allow mysql database
	- Use bulk loading

Don't re-invent the wheel.... use m0mchil's code when we can
	- I didn't fork from there for a reason though Namely different db outlook

Allow auto-adding of usernames OR restrict
- Add a "script" to add,list,disable users

Create a "service" (or whatever) that shows pool level stats.

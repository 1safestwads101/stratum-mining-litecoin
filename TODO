TODO File (in no particular order):

SQL Connection pooling: sqlalchemy
Share Archiving in DB
	- Perhaps separate table for found shares?

Add a "script" to add,list,disable users

Implement a basic share limiter that increases difficulty until share time
	is X seconds between shares

Flush all Pending shares on shutdown (I really don't know how to do this.)

Figure out "Best" submitted difficulty

Handle bitcoind going away (Make sure stats reflect problems)
